        California offers an incredible array and variety of beaches, more than
        many countries. Beachgoers can choose from wide, well-developed beaches
        like Santa Monica or Santa Cruz, lined with places to eat and
        amusements, and unspoiled natural beaches like College Cove in Trinidad,
        closer to Oregon than it is to San Francisco.

        If you're visiting California to experience some of the country’s most
        incredible theme parks, you’re spoiled for choice. All along the coast,
        you’ll find parks of all stripes that you, your friends, or your family
        can enjoy together. Relaxed outdoor adventures, kiddie rides galore, or
        exhilarating thrill rides — California delivers it all.

        California has a wealth of iconic landmarks that let residents and
        visitors alike know they are in the Golden State. Many of these
        landmarks are the state's historic bridges and tunnels that range from
        the spectacular Bay Area and elegant Los Angeles River bridges, to the
        simple and aesthetic bridges of the Central and North Coast, and the
        rustic bridges in rural areas throughout the state.
